    <h1 id="info">What is salami?</h1>
    <p class="text_info">Salami is a cured type of sausage consisting of air-dried and fermented meat. Salami is usually made of pork or beef but varies in size, seasoning, shape, and processing. The origin of Salami is believed to be in Italy, but variants of salami has been found all over the world. In Europe, the main countries that produce salami are Spain, Germany, France, Hungary and Italy. Worldwide, the variants of salami are unique, with their own type of seasoning and even ingredients. In parts of Northern Italy, goose salami is popular. In the Provence region of France, donkey meat is used in the production of salami. Additionally, horse meat has also been used. Other ingredients include garlic, minced fat, salt, herbs, spices, wine and vinegar. Salami making has three vital stepts: preperations of the raw materials, fermentation and then ripening and drying. Some types of salami include winter salami, pepperoni, and spegep√∏lse. Salami has a long shelf life in addition, making it the perfect snack. The etymology of salami comes from the plural form of Italian salame, which means salted meats, but typically refers to just salami. The word comes from the way salami is prepared; sale, meaning salt. Salami is so cool that it has its own national day, which is celebrated on the 7th of September.</p>
