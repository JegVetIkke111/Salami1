    <h1 id="info">What is salami?</h1>
    <p>Salami has its name because of the process in which it is made; salare, Italian: "to salt".<br>Salami is actually just the plural term for salame, meaning salted meat, but currently refers to a specific type of salted meat. It usually consists of fermented and air-dried meat, normally pork or beef, but varies in size, seasoning, shape and processing.<br> 
        The origin of salami is not known, since a variety of different european countries and cultures have their own local version. It was historically popular among poor people in this part of the world because it can be stored at room teperature for up to 40 days after being cut. Salami is cheap and easy to make, and though being raw meat actually lasts for a long time. <br>
